        <p>
            My Name is Chris DeWald, and I recently got married in August, along with about 3 weeks ago got a puppy.<br>
            We got a Chocolate Lab and named him Brooks. He has been taking up alot of our time 
            over the past few weeks but we love him dearly.<br>
            I am studying for my second Bachelor's degree where I hope that I can enter in to the 
            actual Software Development field so that I can do what I love.<br> 
            I am very excited about this class and cannot wait to explore more throughout the next 8 weeks.
