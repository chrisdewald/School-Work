        <h1>About Me - Christopher DeWald</h1>
        <p>My name is Christopher DeWald and I am a full time IT Recruiter and full time Student
            at Liberty University.<br>
            I am eager to learn more about server side programming so that I can better understand
            client side and front end programming to finally earn a position within my cognate
            which is Web and Mobile programming.<br>
            Please have a look around and do not hesitate to reach out to me by going to the contact tab above.
